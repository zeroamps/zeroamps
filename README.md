# Welcome to my profile
My name is Jozef and I have been working as a software engineer for 20 years, developing and maintaining various applications and systems for different domains and platforms.

## My portfolio projects
Sure, I can't share private code of my clients and companies I work for, but I have many hobby and demo projects I learn from, which I can share with you.

- ⚡ I spent some time hacking my old Samsung Galaxy. See this [repository](https://github.com/zeroamps/android).
- ⚡ I like building electronics so I spent lots of time writing C/C++ code for microcontrollers. See this [repository](https://github.com/zeroamps/microcontrollers).
- ⚡ I wanted to try Vite, which is a frontend tooling, so I created React Notes Demo. See this [repository](https://github.com/zeroamps/react-notes-demo).
- ⚡ I wanted to try react-hook-form, which is a React form library, so I created React Weight Conversion Demo. See this [repository](https://github.com/zeroamps/react-weight-conversion-demo).
- ⚡ I needed for one project to convert GUIDs to MongoDB BinData, so I created in Angular a tool for that. See this [repository](https://github.com/zeroamps/mongodb-convert-guid-to-bindata).
- ⚡ For one project I created a Docker image for building Cordova applications. See this [repository](https://github.com/zeroamps/docker-cordova).
- ⚡ This collection of PowerShell examples I created during my PowerShell studying. See this [repository](https://github.com/zeroamps/powershell-sample-scripts).
- ⚡ I use lots of various tools, that's the reason why I created my cheat sheet repository. See this [repository](https://github.com/zeroamps/tooling).
