# Welcome to my profile
My name is Jozef and I have been working as a software engineer for 20 years, developing and maintaining various applications and systems for different domains and platforms. I'm mostly interested in Angular, React and .NET development.

## My portfolio projects
Sure, I can't share private code of my clients and companies I work for, but I have many hobby and demo projects I learn from which I can share with you.  

- I spent some time hacking my old Samsung Galaxy. See this [repository](https://github.com/zeroamps/android).
