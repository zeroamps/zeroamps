# Welcome to my profile
My name is Jozef and I have been working as a software engineer for 20 years, developing and maintaining various applications and systems for different domains and platforms.

## My portfolio projects
Sure, I can't share private code of my clients and companies I work for, but I have many hobby and demo projects I learn from, which I can share with you.
